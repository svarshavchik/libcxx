New features and API changes
============================

x::ref and x::ptr will now detect illegal attempts to construct
refs and ptrs in the object's constructor or destructor, and throw an
exception.

x::ref and x::ptr can now be compared each other for equality.

x::obj::isa<T> template: http://www.libcxx.org/isa.html

Some performance optimizations to x::ref and x::ptr. x::ref and x::ptr
should themselves now be thread-safe.

Implement find_or_create() method for weak maps.

x::exception->caught() method standardizea logging of caught exceptions.

Standardized names of destructor-related callbacks, for consistency.
onAnyDestroyed() replaced with on_any_destroyed(). addOnDestroy() renamed
and replaced with a lambda-based ondestroy().

cxxltdl module - a wrapper for libtool's libltdl library,
http://www.libcxx.org/ltdl.html

API change: x::fd's read() and write() do not throw an exception on an
underlying I/O error, but return an error indication.

API change: several wide character-based classes and templates removed.
The comparable functionality now comes from the courier-unicode library.
Application property names are now UTF-8 strings, instead of wide
character strings. Option long names and descriptions are also now
UTF-8 strings.

Updated gcc build flag to -std=c++1y
