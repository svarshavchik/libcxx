LibCXX requires the /proc filesystem. Add the following to your /etc/fstab:

proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

Then mount /proc. This also mounts /proc automatically when the system boots.
LibCXX applications also require the httportmap daemon. Add the following
to your /etc/rc.conf:

httportmap_enable=YES

And run "/usr/local/etc/rc.d/httportmap start" now (or reboot).

The first time httportmap starts, tlsparamsgen runs to generate the initial
high security ephemeral DH/RSA parameters. This can take a long time. You
should wait until the tlsparamsgen process finishes, before restarting. A link
in /etc/monthly.local also gets added, to run tlsparamsgen to regenerate the
emphemeral parameters monthly.

If you also have the Apache port installed, the LibCXX package automatically
adds a link in etc/apache*/Includes that configures Apache to invoke httportmap
to handle /portmap URLs.

If Apache is not installed, httportmap listens on the http port by itself.
If you install Apache after LibCXX, you need to deinstall and reinstall
LibCXX.
