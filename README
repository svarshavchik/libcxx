After cloning the libcxx repository:

libtoolize
aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoreconf
./configure
make

# The first make will stop with an error at the end, then:

make docs

# Then, once more:

make

This is only needed if checking out directly from the repository, which does
not store autogenerated files.

Then see libcxx documentation for complete build instructions.
