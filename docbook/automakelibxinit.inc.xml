<para>
  The <quote>LIBCXX_INIT</quote> <application>autoconf</application>
  macro sets <varname>LIBCXX_AM</varname> to the include statement
  that pulls in <filename>libcxx.mk</filename>.
</para>

<para>
  <filename>libcxx.mk</filename> does a rudimentary check
  if <varname>AUTOMAKE</varname> is set. If so, it automatically
  generates a <command>make distclean</command> rule to remove
  all targets generated by the macros. The
  <varname>LIBCXX_CLEANFILES</varname> variable
  accumulates the list of targets produced by all macro invocations,
  and may be utilized by non-automake makefiles for similar purposes.
  Additionally, all <filename>.xml</filename> dependencies get added
  to <varname>EXTRA_DIST</varname>. Any assignments to
  <varname>EXTRA_DIST</varname> in <filename>Makefile.am</filename>
  must occur before inclusion of <filename>libcxx.mk</filename>.
  It is permitted to use <literal>+=</literal> to add to
  <varname>EXTRA_DIST</varname> after the inclusion of
  <filename>libcxx.mk</filename>.
